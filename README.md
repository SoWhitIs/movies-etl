#  _What's Next In The Queue?_ || Amazing Prime Video, Extract, Transform, and Load Analysis


## Overview of Project

Amazing Prime Video Team would like to develop an algorithm that will automate a data pipeline for movies slated, primarily low-budget movies, for release so in turn, they can plan to purchase the streaming rights.

To boost morale amongst the team and connect with the local coding community, Amazing Prime Video has decided to host a hackathon. Only except the data needed, requires some extensive _"wrangling"_ for participants use. 

 An extract, transform, and load (or ETL) analysis was performed to scrape, clean, and present the former dataset into two seperate uniformed SQL database of over 6,000 movies releases and  26 million reviews/ratings since 1990.
